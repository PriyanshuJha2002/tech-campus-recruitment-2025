# Discussion

## Solutions Considered

1. **Sequential File Processing**  
   - Approach: Read the log file line by line, check each line against the target date, and write matching entries to the output file.
   - Pros: Simple and memory-efficient.
   - Cons: Could be slower for large files without optimization.

2. **Multithreaded Processing**  
   - Approach: Divide the log file into chunks and process each chunk in parallel threads.
   - Pros: Improves performance on multi-core systems.
   - Cons: Requires careful handling of file chunk boundaries and synchronization.

3. **Indexing Logs by Date**  
   - Approach: Preprocess the log file to index entries by date for quick retrieval.
   - Pros: Very fast for repeated queries.
   - Cons: High initial setup time and increased storage requirements.

## Final Solution Summary

- Chose **Sequential File Processing** due to simplicity, minimal memory overhead, and ease of implementation.
- Optimized for large files by processing line-by-line, reducing memory usage.
- Added proper error handling and output directory creation for robustness.
